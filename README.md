# Point Cloud Fusion Script-V.1
Script that allow to combine multiple scans taken at different instants where an scalar property (i.e. temperature) has been captured and associated to each point. This scripts voxelize the input point clouds and create a unique point cloud, where each point has a set of scalar values associated, that corresponds to each of the acquisition instants.

This is aimed to be used with the Unity application VR Point Cloud Analysis to explore multi-property point cloud using in real-time with virtual reality.
